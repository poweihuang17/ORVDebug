# ORVDebug
ORVDebug is designed as a open source RISC-V debug module that is written in verilog. It's designed as an open implementation for the latest RISC-V debug spec, and it's BSD license. Moreover, the per-hart debug is also being implemented. It's hoped that an open implementation like this could foster the development of RISC-V ecosystem.
